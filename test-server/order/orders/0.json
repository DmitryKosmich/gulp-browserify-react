    "description": "In the above example, instances of Avatar own instances of ProfilePic and ProfileLink. In React, an owner is the component that sets the props of other components. More formally, if a component X is created in component Y's render() method, it is said that X is owned by Y. As discussed earlier, a component cannot mutate its props â€” they are always consistent with what its owner sets them to. This key property leads to UIs that are guaranteed to be consistent."
